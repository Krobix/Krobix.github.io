<p id="p0" style="text-align:center;"> 
On 9/11/2001, four planes were hijacked. Two of these planes hit the World Trade Center, also known as the twin
Towers, in New York. Many people lost their lifes on that day due too us being uninformed on how to handle
situations like that. This site is here to help us remember all of the people who gave their lives to help others.

<p id="p1" style="font-family:courier;">
Dear Heroes, <br /><br />
Thank you for risking your lives to help the lives of so many other people. Your help allowed many people who could have
died to live because you did your job. In that time where so many people needed help, you were there to help them, 
every step of the way. And, despite all of the chaos, you remained calm and did your best to keep the survivors
alive. There is not enough thanks in the world to let you know how appreciated you are.<br /><br /> 

And, finally, thank you to the reader of this site. People like you who want to read to make the world a better place is
what makes the world go round. I hope that people will continue to learn about this to make the world a better place.
<br /> <br />Sincerely, Everyone.
