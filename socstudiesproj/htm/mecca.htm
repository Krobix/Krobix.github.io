<div id="tabcontent">Mansa Musa is known for being the first Muslim ruler of West Africa to make the approximately four
 thousand mile journey to Mecca. <br/><br/> Conflict was quick to arise after he arrived in Cairo, Egypt. Due to law, he had 
 to meet with Cairo's ruler, al-Nasir. During the meeting, however, he refused to pay proper respects. After a disscussion,
 al-Nasir gave him lodging in return for some of his wealth. While this was meant to be a nice gesture, it ruined Egypt's
 economy for several years and spread word about his wealth. Due to the fact that he was the main source of gold
 in that area, he essentially controlled the price of it in the mediterranean.</div>
